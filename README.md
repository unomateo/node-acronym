Javascript Quiz Project

Since I'm also taking a course for node.js, I decided to build the quiz using node.js.

Running a nodejs server is super simple and you will still be using a lot of javascript to 
code the quiz. Nodejs opens up a few additional features.

1. real-time collaboration while taking the quizes. Example, who else is taking the quiz
2. Introduction to game theory. user x just got this question right...

Installation instructions

pre-reqs: install node.js: http://nodejs.org/

```
$ git clone git@github.com:unomateo/node-quiz.git quiz
$ cd quiz
$ node app.js
```

Using your favorite browser, go to http://localhost:3000
